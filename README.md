# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This project was made out of a rubric by Udacity, and it's meant to test acquired knowledge in HTML, CSS, javaScript, and supporting frameworks. It includes a provided engine, images, resources, and basic app code; with the modifications required to make it work.

**Note:** as of this moment, the game cannot be played on a mobile device.

## About the game

### Version 2.0
* Fixed `<code>` in line 107 of *app.js* to correct late collision.
* Improved README file.

### Installation
1. Download the zip file into your computer
1. Unzip the file
1. Double-click *'index.html'* file, so the game loads to your default internet browser
1. Play away!

## How to play

- Use the up, down, left and right keys to walk the streets in search for food and to level up. To level up, you'll need to go beyond the 
grass on the top and into a new street. You'll win the game once you reach level 15!
- Beware of traffic! It gets all crazy the more you level up, and I mean CRAZY.
- You could play this game forever, just be sure to collect as many lives/1ups as you can!


**Have fun! :)**
